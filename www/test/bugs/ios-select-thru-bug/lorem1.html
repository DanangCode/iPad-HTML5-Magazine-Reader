    The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his
    little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and
    steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust
    in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black
    fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air
    above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark
    and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing.
    It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the
    floor, said 'Bother!' and 'O blow!' and also 'Hang spring-cleaning!'
    and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat.
    Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for
    the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gaveled
    carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun
    and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and
    then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working
    busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, 'Up we go! Up we
    go!' till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he
    found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.

    'This is fine!' he said to himself. 'This is better than whitewashing!'
    The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated
    brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long
    the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout.
    Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the
    delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the
    meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.

    'Hold up!' said an elderly rabbit at the gap. 'Sixpence for the
    privilege of passing by the private road!' He was bowled over in an
    instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the
    side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly
    from their holes to see what the row was about. 'Onion-sauce!
    Onion-sauce!' he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could
    think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started
    grumbling at each other. 'How STUPID you are! Why didn't you tell
    him&mdash;&mdash;' 'Well, why didn't YOU say&mdash;&mdash;' 'You might
    have reminded him&mdash;&mdash;' and so on, in the usual way;
    but, of course, it was then much
    too late, as is always the case.

    <p>
    It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the
    meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the
    copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves
    thrusting&mdash;everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And
    instead
    of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering 'whitewash!'
    he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog
    among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday
    is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other
    fellows busy working.

    He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly
    along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in
    his life had he seen a river before&mdash;this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied
    animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and
    leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook
    themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and
    a-shiver&mdash;glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter
    and
    bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of
    the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man
    who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at
    last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him,
    a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the
    heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.
